# Contributing to She's Coding Projects

Welcome üôå , we are excited for you to contribute to She's Coding Projects.   

For OSD we have prepared carefully curated issues you can find in [GHC OSD 2020](https://github.com/shescoding/projects-platform-frontend/projects/1#column-10678147).

### Getting Started
During Open Source Day, we will be doing quick recommendation chats for everyone so you can find the issue that would match your interests and skills. Please reach out to Cheryl (@ctran14), Christina Y (@ceyuen) or Rey(@nurmerey) to start.

### Ways you can contribute

#### Coding 
1. ***Install*** the codebase to your machine following steps in the [wiki](https://github.com/shescoding/projects-platform-frontend/wiki).
2. We recommend you ***pick an issue*** by "Feature" label (ex: "Feature: Project Lead"), and find other attendees working on it, collaborate to work together to implement it. For example: for some features require implementing frontend alongside with the backend APIs. This would be best done by coordinating together and will hopefully be a more fulfilling and fun experience. NOTE: make sure you assign the issue to yourself to avoid any confusion! And please pick only one issue at a time.
3. Once a feature is implemented, ***create a pull request*** and ask for review from any of devs Rey(@nurmerey), Leyla(@leyla-li), Christina(@ceyuen), Nev(@partiallymisplaced).

#### Designing 
We have [a couple tasks](https://github.com/shescoding/projects-platform-frontend/projects/1?card_filter_query=label%3AArtwork) that need either a mockup or UI work. For mentorship and guidance on these please consult Nev(@partiallymisplaced).

#### Improving Documentation
Documentation can always be improved. If you find these opportunities, please consult a project representative about it. Here are some ways you can contribute to documentation:
- Add screenshots where it might be helpful.
- Elaborate in more steps existing documentation.
- Create a video instruction of doing some steps.
- Adding GIFs to make it more fun.
- Add missing steps.
- Adding more context, ex: a flow diagram.

#### Found a bug or have an idea?
This is great, please go ahead and create an issue in [Feature Requests/Ideas column](https://github.com/shescoding/projects-platform-frontend/projects/1#column-7985599) or [Backlog](https://github.com/shescoding/projects-platform-frontend/projects/1#column-6891004) column. 

If it is an idea, please make sure it does not already exists in [GHC OSD 2020](https://github.com/shescoding/projects-platform-frontend/projects/1#column-10678147) column already. If it doesn't, then go ahead create a new issue and describe in as many details as you can, including if appropriate, any mockups that might help understand it. 

If it is a bug, make sure to include Expected, and Actual behaviors and please add screenshots if it is a visible issue.
